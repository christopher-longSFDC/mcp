/**
 If this context is currently active or not.
 
 A typical `<EVGScreen>` context is active when the screen is visible and the app is not backgrounded.
 
 Besides some initial setup just before becoming visible/active (`<setCampaignHandler:forTarget:>`, `<viewItem:>` etc),
 activity generally occurs while a context is active.
 
 Context activity, in addition to app state and user idleness, can affect campaign delivery, see `<setCampaignHandler:forTarget:>`

/**
 To optionally support custom 'Data' campaigns, register a campaign handler for
 the app-defined target within this context. Can set `nil` to clear.
 
 Campaigns can potentially be received in response to actions (see `<trackAction:>`) and item interactions (see `<viewItem:>` etc) tracked on this context.
 
 The `target` is an app-defined string that uniquely identifies the payload data
 schema - what the data represents and its purpose.
 See `<[EVGCampaign target]>`.
 
 While the context, app, and user is active, the handler may receive asynchronous callbacks (on the main thread)
 with campaigns for the target, in response to actions/events sent. The handler code should show/update the campaign to the user,
 when appropriate, and follow best practices using weak references, see `<EVGCampaignHandler>` for example code.
 
 Campaigns may be held for delivery while either:
 
 - The context, app, or user is inactive
 - No handler is found for the campaign's target within this context
 
 For each context and target, only the most recent campaign will be held.
 
 Lifecycle details for an `<EVGScreen>` based context:
 
 - Recommended to always call this method just before becoming visible, specifically `UIViewController viewWillAppear:`.
 - In order to prevent accidental leaks in the handler block (see `weak` references in  `<EVGCampaignHandler>` example code to prevent this), a screen has a limited time to become visible, after which its handlers and held campaigns will be cleared.
 - When a screen transitions to not visible (`viewWillDisappear:`), all handlers and held campaigns are cleared.
 
 These limitations and automatic cleanup do not apply to `<[Evergage globalContext]>`.
 
 @param handler The campaign handler this context should use for the specified target.
 @param target App-defined string that uniquely identifies the payload data schema - what the data represents and its purpose. See `<[EVGCampaign target]>`

 You do not normally need to call this method. It tracks a click on custom UI

 Evergage automatically tracks clicks on push notifications. However, when the
 notification is received while the app is in the foreground, the notification
 is not automatically shown to the user. If you are using `UNUserNotificationDelegate`,
 you have some options with `userNotificationCenter:willPresentNotification:withCompletionHandler` :
 
 - If you don't show anything to the user, there is no click to track.
 - If you show the notification with UNNotificationPresentationOptionAlert,
   Evergage will automatically track any user click.
 - If you don't show the notification, but instead render some other UI based
   on the notification, and want to track user clicks, call this method when
   the user clicks on the associated UI.
 
 @param notification The notification/userInfo as received from iOS.
